What is Yii
===========

Yii is a high-performance, component-based PHP framework for developing
large-scale Web applications rapidly. It enables maximum reusability in Web
programming and can significantly accelerate your Web application development
process. The name Yii (pronounced `Yee` or `[ji:]`) is an acronym for
"**Yes It Is!**".


Requirements
------------

To run a Yii-powered Web application, you need a Web server that supports
PHP 5.3.?.

For developers who want to use Yii, understanding object-oriented
programming (OOP) is very helpful, because Yii is a pure OOP framework.


What is Yii Best for?
---------------------

Yii is a generic Web programming framework that can be used for developing
virtually any type of Web application.  Because it is light-weight and
equipped with sophisticated caching mechanisms, it is especially suited
to high-traffic applications, such as portals, forums, content
management systems (CMS), e-commerce systems, etc.


How does Yii Compare with Other Frameworks?
-------------------------------------------

Like most PHP frameworks, Yii is an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.
